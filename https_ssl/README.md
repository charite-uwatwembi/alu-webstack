HTTPS SSL stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure Secure Sockets Layer. It is a combination of the HTTP protocol and the SSL/TLS encryption protocol. HTTPS is used to secure communication between a client (such as a web browser) and a server over the internet. SSL/TLS encryption ensures that the data transmitted between the client and server is encrypted and cannot be easily intercepted or tampered with by attackers. HTTPS is commonly used for secure communication in web applications, online banking, e-commerce websites, and other sensitive online transactions.

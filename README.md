Web stack, also known as a web application stack or simply a tech stack, refers to the collection of technologies and software components used to build and run web applications. It typically consists of several layers and components that work together to handle different aspects of web development.

A typical web stack includes the following layers:

Client-side: This layer includes the technologies that run on the client's browser or device, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These technologies handle the user interface and interactivity of the web application.

Server-side: This layer includes the technologies that run on the server and handle the business logic and data processing of the web application. Common server-side technologies include programming languages like Python, Java, Ruby, or Node.js, as well as frameworks like Django, Spring, Ruby on Rails, or Express.js.

Database: This layer includes the technologies used to store and manage data for the web application. Common databases used in web development include MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or Redis.

Web server: This layer includes the software responsible for handling HTTP requests from clients and serving web pages and resources. Popular web servers include Apache HTTP Server, Nginx, or Microsoft IIS.

Additionally, other components like caching systems, load balancers, security tools, and content delivery networks (CDNs) can also be part of a web stack depending on the application's requirements.

The choice of technologies in a web stack depends on various factors, such as the specific needs of the application, performance requirements, scalability, and developer preferences. Different combinations of technologies can be used to create a web stack, and there is no one-size-fits-all solution.
